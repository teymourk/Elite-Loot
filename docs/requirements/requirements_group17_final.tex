\section{Introduction}
Our project involves the creation of an iOS application by utilizing eBay public buying APIs to help eBay understand the eSports market and provide shopping opportunities. 
Our challenge is to target millennial gamers and connect to a variety of different APIs. 
We will utilize event and eSports APIs to display information desired by gamers. 
The primary purpose of the application is to make it easier for customers to purchase eSports merchandise and find information about eSports events. 

\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the iOS mobile application is to provide access to eSports merchandise sold by eBay and display information about upcoming eSports events. The application will provide users a wider range of shopping opportunities by connecting them with products that interest them through a relatively simple, streamlined, easy-to-use browse process. 

\par End users will also be able to view Twitter feeds about upcoming eSports events. This social component has many added benefits, one of which is making the application more personal. It will also help eBay stand out as a more attractive purchasing option and help to consolidate eSports information into one place so that users can receive updates about their favorite games. 

\par Technical goals include building an application outside of eBay that uses its various public APIs and integrates with Google Firebase for authentication. This application will also test the ability to develop on those public APIs. 

\par For us, as developers, this application will demonstrate an ability to adhere to current human interface guidelines detailed in the Apple developer guidelines. We will also gain valuable software development experience to prepare us for larger scale projects that we can expect to see in our careers.

\subsection{Scope}
Our main goal is to create an application that helps eBay learn more about the eSports market and new shopping opportunities for eBay. The software will allow users to find and purchase eSports merchandise that is being sold on eBay. We also want to create an environment for millennial gamers to learn more about upcoming eSports events around the world.

\subsection{Performance requirements}
The completion of project requirements is more important than raw performance. Therefore, most of our performance metrics will be qualitative requirements. This is because gated networks can make it difficult to measure performance accurately and we will be limited by factors outside of our control. Our performance will be measured by our ability to integrate with eBay APIs and Firebase. Currently, our goal to shoot for a maximum of 2 second page load. Metrics may be tweaked in the future to avoid being overly ambitious on performance.

\subsection{Design constraints}
We will be designing our UI based on what is achievable with default libraries in Swift and Xcode. 
 
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
We will be obtaining proper licensing from Apple to develop this native application since our application will developed specifically for the protected iOS system.

\subsection{Software system attributes}
This section includes how reliable, available, secure, maintainable, and portable our application will be.

\subsubsection{Reliability}
This application should be able to display the latest up and coming eSport's events, and not display an event that has passed. The application should also consistently show relevant merchandise when the user selects a specific game or event from the Browse screen.

\subsubsection{Availability}
The application will only be available to user's who have iPhone devices. These devices must have the latest iOS 11 OS. Those users must also be connected to the internet to use our application.

\subsubsection{Security}
We will be using Firebase security system that is provided by Firebase. Some of the APIs that we are using also provide HTTPS security calls.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}
We will be maintaining the software by making sure everything we have is fully functional and optimized. Also, we will make it our priority that our Firebase backend runs pretty smoothly when fetching to avoid delays and high memory usage.

\subsubsection{Portability}
This application will only be usable on iPhone devices with iOS 11, this means iPhones without the latest OS or other devices will not be able to run the application.
