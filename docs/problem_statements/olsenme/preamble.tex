        	This project includes the creation of an IOS application to display esports merchandise for sale and announce esports events. The challenge is to create an application independent of Ebay in order to test some of the public ApIs that eBay has already created. The application will serve as a proof of concept for future applications that might use these APIs. The application will also include some form of social component which is yet to be decided. The application will be built on a MacOX platform using swift as the primary programming language. There will also be an authentication component, which will be handled using some of the services of Firebase.

\section{Definition and Description of Problem}
\par Ebay is already heavily invested in the esports market, promoting esports events, merchandise, and creating public APIs. These APIs are publicly available to be used by anyone interested in developing an application using ebay infrastructure.
\par While epsorts is a huge community, it is not necessarily as heavily advertised and promoted as much as other sports. Ebay wants to change that by helping esports establish itself as its own sports category. Our client, previous head of software development for both IOS and Android at ebay and currently working in buyer experiences for native applications managing a services team has an expressed personal interest in the esports market and wants to lead the corporation in exploring that interest more in depth.
\par The application is targeted at millenial gamers to help them sort of get connected with  others around the world who share their interest in esports through an application which allows for communication via some form of social media. It is meant to facilitate communication about esports related  events and establish ebay as a favorable option for gamers wishing to purchase their favorite esports products in accordance with current esports trends.
\section{Proposed Solution}
\par The project will result in a separate native IOS application which utilizes ebay's public APIs. The application will be built on the latest version of IOS and Xcode.The entire code repository will be public, and it will be hosted on GitHub version control using likely 
Github or Googledocs for individual task management. The application will be implemented in predominantly swift programming language with possible small amounts contributed from objective.The solution will be delivered as third party project and will not include anything that a public developer does not currently have access to. This application will not be backend system-machine heavy. It will not have a revenue aspect unless the client approves of it.Though the application targets millenial gamers, it will not have any gaming aspects.It will not include live feeds for current scores.The focus of the application will be primarily to display esports merchandise and events with a strong social emphasis.
\par The application will display upcoming esports events in some form at the minimum, preferably in some sort of visual fashion. Although this is yet to be determined, this will likely occur in the form of a calendar dedicated to displaying esports events.Some examples of the types of esports events that we want to include would be League,PAX, and BLIZZCON.This will be implemented through a dynamic calendar, which will likely pull in esports events into a calendar around 7 days before an event.
\par The application will also be able to display specific esports merchandise and allow the end user(likely a gamer) to interact with that merchandise. This will likely have a search option, allowing the user to the flexibility to search for the kind of merchandise that they want to display products if that is their preferred method of shopping while also providing suggestions of available merchandise that is relevant to current trends.This "suggested" merchandise will be dynamic at any given time. The suggested merchandise  will be chosen according to data that is gathered concerning recent esports events and trends.The application may or may not include the ability to purchase available merchandise.
\par The application will also allow for connection to some other existing form of social media such as Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter, Youtube, League, Blizzard's Overwatch feed, and/or Riot's feed.The exact form is yet to be determined and is, at this point, intentionally left as an area for innovation and creativity within the project.The application will not be overloaded with outside social media connections. Some forms of social media, if chosen to be used, will require us to register APIs.
\par As of right now, the proposed plan is to use Firebase on the back end as a log on system. One of the options that we are currently exploring to help us with this is authnet, which allows for free account creation and provides many services that could be helpful to us in completing this task.
\par Lastly, the eventual goal of the application is for it to be deployed to the IStore through GitHub and win the Capstone prize to complete a second year run for eBay. This application will likely not be published under an ebay name but rather perhaps some sub-company of ebay.
\par As an added bonus, we would like to incorporate additional Apple ads of esports related products. However, this is not a core requirement.
\section{Performance Metrics}
For any and all performance metrics, we reserve the right to tweak as we progress throughout the project.
\begin{itemize}
   \item  Each developer will be working from own account as a registered apple developer.
   \item The Application will be tested on actual device multiple times before completion
     \item Application will adhere to iOS design standards
      \item The finished UI will include a nice graphical display with nice being defined as visually appealing to the average eye with a icons and other visual symbols adhering to solid usability principles.
	   \item Each person will create their own tab for delegation of work. 
        \item The application will have the ability to integrate with Firebase and generate Firebase system.
         \item The application will integrate with ebay public APIS and surface merchandise
          \item The application will have the ability to successfully complete an activity yet to be determined.
           \item Performance metrics are largely outside our control because the application will be gated on a network outside our control.
            \item The application integrates with other services.
The page load time is reasonable, where reasonable is defined as
around 2 seconds.
