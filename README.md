# eBay eSports (CS461)

## Problem Statement 
eBay would like to make use of recently released public buying APIs in order to explore the eSports market and target new customers, as they currently do not have any products that attract millennial gamers. On the market today there arent any known products that make it easy for eSports fans to find merchandise and receive updates about their favorite games. The existing solution involves visiting individual social media pages and sites, as there are few websites or applications that consolidate information about different eSports events. In order to purchase eSports merchandise, users need to navigate to the official website of game companies they are interested in, such as Riot or Blizzard. From there they need to visit the dedicated store page and begin the shopping process, which can be quite time consuming. Another issue is if a user follows a lot of games, it can be difficult to keep track of the various upcoming events. The focus of the iOS eSports project is to develop an application that contains useful information about eSports, such as upcoming eSports events and dates, and allows customers to purchase products on eBay relating to those upcoming events.
