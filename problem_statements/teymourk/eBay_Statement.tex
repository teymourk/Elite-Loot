\section{Problem Definition}
There many gamers out there that love different gaming merchandise and events that they would like to attend. With new eBays public API, we will be studying our users and finding a way to create a market and esPorts eBay merchandise. We eventually want to allow our users to be able to shop or browse fro these type of products that they might be interested in. 


\section{Proposed Solution}
Our goal is to come up with an application that can help users find eSports event that 
they might want to attend. This will also create a lot of shopping opportunities for the user and will target the eBay market much easier. We want to be able to create something that is easy to use with a great user experience friendly interface. Users are also able to share the events through different social media APIs like twitter and facebook to share and pull different pieces of information regarding an event. Firebase will also be used to keep track of users information when registered along with eSports scores that will be given. Targetting millennial gamers is our focus and we would like to expand this further when we publish the application on the app store. We are using Apple new programming language Swift and Xcode IDE to achieve all these goals.

\section{Performance Metrics}
We want to make sure that we will achieve every aspect of the application documented. We want our app to be fully ready and published by the end of the year. All that being said, our performance metric is to make sure we fully achieve retrieving data from all the given APIs and successfully presenting it on the application. We also want to be able to have Firebase fully working as out backend to allow our users register and login. Facebook and Twitter as our main source of advertising and sharing, we want to fully have them integrated. Lastly, eBay eSports merchandise as our primary goal will be to all users explore their options easier to create a better shopping opportunity and experience.
