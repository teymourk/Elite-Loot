        	Our project is to create an iOS eSports application for eBay.
            Our goal is to target millennial gamers to better understand the eSports market and learn about the potential shopping opportunities.
            To accomplish this, we will be testing out eBay’s new public buying APIs while utilizing pre-existing event and eSports score APIs to connect eSports users with a shopping experience.
            The application will be written using the Swift programming language and using Firebase as the backend to allow us to gather analytics easily to discover the best and most efficient way to sell eBay’s products to the user.
            We will also be adding a social component to our application, giving the user the option to share their findings on Twitter and Facebook.

\section{Problem Definition}
	Our objective is to test the new public buying APIs for eBay. We also want to learn about the eSports market, and the shopping opportunities that exist in that market. To learn about selling opportunities in the eSports market, we will be specifically targeting millennial gamers. We also want to add a social component to the application, integrating the Twitter and Facebook APIs. It should be known we have not yet met with our client, so there is a lot left to be filled in.

\section{Proposed Solution}
Iniorder to test eBay’s new APIs, we will do what is discussed with us in the clients meeting. I will then go into detail about what kind of app we are developing, how we plan on testing those APIs. To target millennial gamers, we will be creating an interface that allows the user to browse upcoming eSports events and check scores via pre-existing eSports APIs. To add a social component, we will be connecting our application to the Twitter and Facebook API. I will insert what this component entails once we discuss it with the client. To create the application for an iOS device, we will be using the Swift language. The application will use Firebase as the backend to help provide analytics and bug reports that allow us to optimize and tweak the application while learning about our target market.

\section{Performance Metrics}
Our performance will be measured by our success in accomplishing several different tasks for this application. The first is that the application must connect to the event and eSports score APIs, and display it for the user to see. Secondly, the application must be connected to both the Twitter and Facebook APIs, and utilize them in the way discussed in our meeting. Lastly, the application will use eBay’s new APIs and allow the user to purchase items.
